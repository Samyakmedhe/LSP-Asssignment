# LSP Assignment

A collection of Linux System Programming (LSP) assignments written in C.  
This repository includes multiple lab assignments covering essential file handling, directory traversal, and system-level programming concepts using POSIX APIs.


Each assignment folder contains the source code and sample input/output for a specific LSP task.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This repository demonstrates practical implementations of:

- File I/O using `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`
- Directory traversal with `opendir()` and `readdir()`
- File metadata and status with `stat()` / `lstat()`
- File manipulation (`unlink`, `rename`, `chmod`, etc.)
- Buffered file copying and permission preservation
- Searching, deletion, and file filtering operations
